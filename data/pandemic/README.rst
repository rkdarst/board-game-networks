Pandemic and expansions
=======================

Pandemic is a disease spreading game.  The underlying mathematical model
is the sandpile model.


Pandemic
--------

The base game.  There is a single node attribute ``color``.

Pandemic: Hinterlands expansion
-------------------------------

This expansion has three different versions, but one of them expands
the network with four new "hinterlands" nodes, which have the node
attribute ``type=hinterlands``.  These nodes can be used for movement
as well as disease spreading.


Pandemic Legacy Season 1
------------------------

A legacy version of Pandemic.  All cities are the same, but edges are
slightly adjusted.  There is also a new attribute ``region``: all
cities are divided into one of six regions.


Pandemic Legacy Season 2
------------------------

This game isn't here yet.  Note that when it is here, it will contain
spoilers, since the network is hidden at the start of the game.
