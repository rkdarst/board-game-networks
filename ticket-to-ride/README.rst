Ticket to Ride Europe
---------------------

* `Rules <https://ncdn0.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/img/7202-T2RE-Rules-EN-2019.pdf>`_

* There are 110 train cards (12 per color, 14 wild (locomotives)

* ``tunnel``: edge attribute, value of zero or one.  This edge is a
  tunnel.  You must draw cards from the deck, and for any card
  matching the colors you are trying to playing, you must discard one
  extra card of that color.  There are special rules for wilds
  (locomotives) here.  So, for a regular colored play, this becomes
  about 24% ((12+14)/110) more expensive.

* ``locomotives``: edge attribute, value is number of wild
  (locomotives) needed to be played for this edge.
